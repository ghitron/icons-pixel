### icons-pixel
This is a collection of pixelated icons that i created for my desktop. Maybe someone finds something they like despite this being just some dilettante private work :)

### Content

As of now there are just 21 icons total (with many just being different versions of the same thing). But i will probably keep adding stuff over the time.
